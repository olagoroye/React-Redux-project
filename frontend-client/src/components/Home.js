            <p>Babies come with different essentials, Baby A's need maybe diffrent from Baby B's. This is because babies tend to exhibit differences and preferences in what they like. One of the many 
                struggles I had when I first became a home, was my getting the right bottle. I believe I tried a couple of bottles before my first baby started feeding well</p>
            <p>On my second i though, Okay I got this figured but that was a big lie until I used a different bottle. The app is basically to help you make good and accurate decision, while you are showing for your baby feeding essentials </p>
            <p>The ultra soft, breast-shaped nipple encourages a natural latch and mimics the feel of a breast, making the switch between breast and bottle as smooth as possible for you and your baby.</p>
